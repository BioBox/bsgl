# Baileysoft Game Loader

The Baileysoft game loader is a program that keeps track of your play time for any game, but will also work with any executable file.

## Requirements

Since this is written in **C#**, it is required that you have the .NET framework on your system.

Support for other platforms using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) is currently under development.

## Basic Usage

Checkout the [quick-start guide](QuickStart.pdf).

There's also a [youtube video](https://youtu.be/WRSY0bcxuX0) that shows you how to use it.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks goes to Neal Bailey for providing me with his excellent code.
